README for Feedback Systems 2e Python files
RMM, 20 Jun 2021

This directory contains Python code for the examples and selected in the
second edition of Feedback Systems by Astrom and Murray.

The file corresponding to each example (or figure, if there is not a
corresponding example) has the form

  example_N-m_shorttitle.py
  figure_N-m_shorttitle.py

where 'N' is the chapter number and 'm' is the example number.  If you
run the file in python, it will produce the figures that appear in the
text.  Note that some figures may look slightly different due to
Matplotlib formatting.

These example use the Python Control Systems Library (python-control),
which is available via PIP, Conda, or GitHub.  See python-control.org
for more information.
