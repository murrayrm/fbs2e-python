README for Feedback Systems 2e Python files
RMM, 20 Jun 2021

This directory contains Python code for the examples and selected figures
in the second edition of Feedback Systems by Astrom and Murray.

The file corresponding to each example (or figure, if there is not a
corresponding example) has the form

  example-N.m-short_title.py
  figure-N.m-short_title.py

where 'N' is the chapter number and 'm' is the example number.  If you
run the file in Python, it will produce the figures that appear in the
text.  Some figures may look slightly different due to Matplotlib
formatting, and depending on your environment you may need to enter
`plt.show()` to tell matplotlib to show the figure.

These examples use the Python Control Systems Library (python-control),
which is available via PIP, Conda, or GitHub.  See python-control.org
for more information.

Several modules are included that are imported in multiple examples and
figures:

* cruise.py: vehicle dynamics and PI controller
* fbs.py: FBS plotting customizations (to match the style of the text)
