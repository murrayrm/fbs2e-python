# Figure 3.2: Illustration of a state model. A state model gives the rate of
# change of the state as a function of the state. The plot on the left shows
# the evolution of the state as a function of time. The plot on the right,
# called a phase portrait, shows the evolution of the states relative to
# each other, with the velocity of the state denoted by arrows.

# Spring mass system with nonlinear dampling
#
# This function gives the dynamics for a dampled oscillator with nonlinear
# damping.  The states of the system are
#
#   x[0]        position
#   x[1]        velocity
#
# The nonlinear damping is implemented as a change in the linear damping
# coefficient at a small velocity.  This is intended to roughly correspond
# to some sort of stiction (and give an interesting phase portrait).  The
# default parameters for the system are given by
#
#   m = 1       mass, kg
#   k = 1       spring constant, N/m
#   b1 = 1      damping constant near origin, N-sec/m
#   b2 = 0.01   damping constant away from origin, N-sec/m
#   dth = 0.5   threshold for switching between damping
#
# This corresponds to a fairly lightly damped oscillator away from the origin.
