# Figure 3.2: Illustration of a state model. A state model gives the rate of
# change of the state as a function of the state. The plot on the left shows
# the evolution of the state as a function of time. The plot on the right,
# called a phase portrait, shows the evolution of the states relative to
# each other, with the velocity of the state denoted by arrows.

# Spring mass system with nonlinear dampling
#
# This function gives the dynamics for a dampled oscillator with nonlinear
# damping.  The states of the system are
#
#   x[0]        position
#   x[1]        velocity
#
# The nonlinear damping is implemented as a change in the linear damping
# coefficient at a small velocity.  This is intended to roughly correspond 
# to some sort of stiction (and give an interesting phase portrait).  The 
# default parameters for the system are given by
#
#   m = 1       mass, kg
#   k = 1       spring constant, N/m
#   b1 = 1      damping constant near origin, N-sec/m
#   b2 = 0.01   damping constant away from origin, N-sec/m
#   dth = 0.5   threshold for switching between damping
#
# This corresponds to a fairly lightly damped oscillator away from the origin.

def nlspringmass(x, t, u=0, m=1, k=1, b1=2, b2=0.01, dth=0.2):
    # Compute the friction force
    if abs(x[1]) < dth:
        Fb = b1 * x[1];
    elif x[1] < 0:
        Fb = -b1 * dth \
            + b2 * (x[1] + dth);
    else:
        Fb = b1 * dth \
            + b2 * (x[1] - dth);

    # Return the time derivative of the state
    return np.array([x[1], -k/m * x[0] - Fb/m])
